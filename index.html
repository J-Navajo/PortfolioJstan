            <p>Ya'ah'teeh (Greetings in Navajo language)
                
                My name is Jennifer Stanley. You are welcome to call me "J". I am from Kayenta, Az, 
                located on the Navajo Reservation, just 21-22 miles south of the Utah/Arizona border.
                I come from a big family of 7 siblings with lots of cousins and nieces and nephews. I
                am somewhat in the middle. I moved to Phoenix, Az about 4 years ago after working in
                New Mexico for a Tribal College building their online program and Dual Credit department.
                <br><br>
                After high school I attended the University of Arizona and earned my Bachelor of Science
                in Agriculture Technology Management. I received my Masters in Agriculture Education
                and Educational Technology also from the University of Arizona. Can you tell I didn't
                want to leave UofA? Now I am back again attending the Coding Bootcamp course. 
                <br><br>
                Some of my interests include but not limited to; painting, drawing, spending time
                with family/friends, sports, being active, going for a spontaneous drive, and designing. 
                Although I am horrible at drawing and designing I keep at it because I beleive in practice
                makes perfect. 
                <br><br>
                Currently, I work for the devil (ASU), as an Instructional Designer for the Engineering 
                department. I enjoy building and designing online courses with professors when they're 
                willing and excited to work together. Although I work for ASU I am a diehard wildcats fan.
                I still follow the UofA basketball as much as time will allow. I've been called a traitor
                by friends, family, and coworkers (all in good fun). Thank you for stopping by my page.
